AUTONOMOUS MULTI-SENSOR ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING NODE
COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND NETWORK ENGINEERING
--- Slide 5 ---
Existing Wireless Sensor Network nodes deployed in disconnected zones often fail to achieve long-term autonomy due to poor power management and inefficient on-node data handling.
Current compression strategies in constrained devices are underexplored – most rely on either no compression or basic entropy methods without rigorous evaluation for energy vs. performance trade-offs.
Knowledge Gap or Problem Definition
Nodes consume excessive energy under single-mode operation; many systems collapse in weeks or months.
Data transmission without compression wastes bandwidth and increases latency in UAV ferrying.
No comparative study exists showing which entropy-based compression is better suited for ESP32-class hardware in WSNs.
Shortcomings of Existing Systems
Introduce a Power Management Engine with three adaptive modes for longevity and self-healing.
Evaluate Huffman vs. LZ-family compression directly on ESP32-S3 to provide evidence-based guidance on the most energy-efficient approach for resource-constrained WSN nodes.
This fills a research gap by combining power-aware design + practical compression benchmarking for disconnected WSNs.

AUTONOMOUS CLUSTER FORMATION AND CLUSTER HEAD SELECTION SYSTEM
--- Slide 10 ---
Gap Analysis
Weakness in Current Protocols
Existing clustering protocols for WSNs (e.g., LEACH, HEED) are not robust when applied to disconnected, resource-constrained environments.
Research Aim
Develop an autonomous cluster formation algorithm that is more reliable and secure.
Shortcomings of 
Existing Systems
Energy-focused protocols (LEACH, HEED) neglect trust, fairness, and persistence.
Lack of authentication is vulnerable to spoofing & replay attacks.
No trust evaluation (packet reliability, handshake integrity).
Absence of uptime persistence, leading to unfair CH rotation.
Proposed Solution
Multi-parameter CH election formula (Battery, Uptime, Trust, Link Quality).
Secure CH announcements with HMAC over BLE extended advertisements.
RTC memory persistent uptime tracking.
Improves robustness, survivability, and fairness of WSNs in harsh, infrastructure-less environments.

System Overview
General Architecture

Sensor nodes self-organize into clusters.
A Cluster Head (CH) is elected using a secure, fair, and multi-parameter algorithm.
The elected CH is responsible for local coordination until UAV pickup.
Node Level Behaviour 
Neighbour Discovery:
Each ESP32-S3 node periodically broadcasts BLE extended advertisements to announce its presence.
Score Calculation:
Every node computes a composite election score based on:
Battery Level: Normalised via ADC readings.
Uptime: Persistent tracking using RTC memory.
Trust Score: Calculated from handshake success rate, packet delivery ratio, and neighbour feedback.
Link Quality: Evaluated using RSSI and packet error rate (PER).
Score Exchange:
Nodes broadcast their computed score securely to neighbours.
CH Election:
The node with the highest verified score is elected as the Cluster Head. Ties are resolved by MAC address.
Security & Trust Enforcement
Authentication:
CH announcements are broadcast using HMAC-SHA256, preventing spoofing and replay attacks.
Trust Filtering:
Nodes with trust scores below a set threshold are automatically excluded from CH candidacy.
Verification:
Cluster members validate the HMAC before recognizing the CH.
