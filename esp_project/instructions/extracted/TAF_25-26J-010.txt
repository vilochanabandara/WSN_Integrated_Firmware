Autonomous Data Ferrying from a Self-Organizing/Healing WSN in Disconnected Zones   CI - Computing Infrasrtucture 
Computer Systems and Network Engineering(CSNE) 
In many critical environments such as disaster zones, remote wildlands and military border regions, traditional wireless communication infrastructure is either unavailable, unstable, or actively avoided. Despite these constraints, monitoring such environments using Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) remains essential for tasks such as environmental sensing, surveillance, disaster response, and infrastructure assessment. The key challenges in such disconnected environments are lack of continuous connectivity, limited power availability, dynamic topologies due to node failures, and the need for resilient data delivery without fixed backhaul networks. Standard WSNs fail under these conditions due to reliance on fixed gateways, preconfigured routing, and centralized synchronization. This research proposes a self-organizing WSN architecture that operates in disconnected environments using a mobile data ferry (UAV equipped with a Raspberry Pi) and a dynamically elected Cluster Head (CH) within each sensor cluster. Each MS (Main Set) continuously senses its environment and locally stores its data. CHs are selected dynamically through coordination among all MS nodes in the cluster, based on metrics such as energy level, trust score, uptime, and sensor availability. This coordination uses a lightweight mesh structure solely for CH election purposes. Once elected, the CH periodically initiates communication with each MS in its cluster to request and collect their stored sensor data. The CH then acts as the cluster’s interface to the data ferry, which retrieves buffered data using BLE-triggered ESP32-based wireless communication. Upon retrieval by the ferry, all data is transmitted to the base station. There, a centralized dashboard system visualizes the sensor network in real time, displaying cluster health, MS battery levels, CH status, data flow direction, sensor values, and alerts. This empowers remote operators to monitor environmental conditions, track data lineage, identify failing nodes, and assess network health, all without live connectivity in the field. The system is designed to be power-adaptive each MS monitors its battery level and can fall back to passive or deep-sleep modes during critical conditions, broadcasting periodic low-battery alerts. Trust filtering is embedded to avoid accepting corrupt or tampered data from faulty or malicious sensors. The

This research proposes a novel Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) architecture that enables autonomous, delay-tolerant data ferrying from a disconnected, self-organizing, and power aware sensor ecosystem. The system is composed of Main set nodes (MS) equipped with ESP32 microcontroller, BLE Module and up to Maximum four sensors (audio, video, image, and other environmental sensors). These MS units are deployed in clusters across a terrain with no existing network infrastructure. Each cluster autonomously elects a Cluster Head (CH) using a lightweight algorithm that prioritizes battery level, node health, uptime, and trustworthiness. The CH acts as an interface to access data localized to that specific cluster. All MS units continuously sense and store data, regardless of the ferry’s presence. A mobile ferry (UAV or robot) patrols the environment and wirelessly collects data from the CHs when it enters proximity. Detection is triggered using BLE beaconing, which activates the CH’s ESP-NOW interface for fast, infrastructure less data exchange. This eliminates the need for permanent gateways or real-time backhaul. Each MS is power aware, dynamically entering passive or deep-sleep modes depending on its battery status. Low-battery alerts and power state transitions are communicated to the CH and ultimately the dashboard at headquarters via the ferry. The solution supports modular deployment, dynamic CH reelection, dynamic routing, and energy-aware sensing. The base station dashboard visualizes node health, cluster structure, power modes, and data flow direction, enabling centralized monitoring of a decentralized system.

Trust filtering is embedded to avoid accepting corrupt or tampered data from faulty or malicious sensors. The system is designed for rapid deployment using modular sensor packs and can recover from CH failures via self-healing election logic. Unlike traditional WSNs, this approach avoids the need for live connectivity, backhaul routers, or cloud control, making it uniquely suited for disconnected, high-risk, infrastructure-less environments.

IT4010 Research Project – 2025 July Topic Assessment Form             7. Brief description of specialized domain expertise, knowledge, and data requirements (300 words max)     To build and deploy this system effectively, the project team will require hands-on experience with embedded systems, low-power wireless communication, and sensor network design. The hardware platform is based on ESP32 microcontrollers, which support both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Core expertise involves integrating environmental sensors (e.g., temperature, gas, motion) with these microcontrollers, ensuring reliable data acquisition, timestamping, and local storage in memory (SPIFFS or EEPROM). A solid understanding of BLE and ESP-NOW communication protocols is crucial for this project. BLE is used to help the Cluster Head (CH) detect when the UAV (ferry) is nearby, using low-power proximity signals. Once the ferry is close enough, the CH activates its Wi-Fi radio and uses ESP-NOW to send data. ESP-NOW allows devices to exchange information directly without needing any internet or router, which makes it ideal for this kind of offline, low-power network. The team also needs to manage how sensor readings are collected, stored, and prepared for transmission which involves setting up timers, queues, and logic to trigger communication only when necessary, conserving as much power as possible. The system also involves power-adaptive behavior. This requires configuring the ESP32 to dynamically switch between active sensing, passive listening, and deep sleep modes based on battery level. Nodes must report their power state and battery warnings to the CH, which queues this data for collection by the UAV. Basic knowledge of solar recharging systems is also beneficial, as sensor units are designed to recover autonomously in the field when sunlight is available. On the UAV side, the system requires moderate familiarity with Raspberry Pi or similar SBC platforms. The UAV is responsible for scanning, detecting nearby CH nodes, and collecting buffered data wirelessly when in range. Finally, the backend includes a base station dashboard that parses incoming data logs, displays sensor health, node status, and battery trends. Visualization and alerting logic are built using JSON data formats, simple web interfaces, and mapping tools. Test data will be generated during real-world deployment trials in clustered environments to simulate disconnection and ferry-based collection cycles.
